title : Introducing Delphus
description : |
  <p><strong>Introducing our flagship product: Delphus</strong>, a platform for trust and compliance powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Previously known as reBlock, the current iteration of our product targets research inefficiency through a secure, decentralized study management platform.</p>

  <p>Using the blockchain, Delphus immutably timestamps and records all consent and data points to provide transparency at every step. It stores data on a network of servers around the world, preserving data accessibility and allowing control on a per-site and per-investigator basis. This makes research auditable and verifiable, saving trust, time, and money.</p>
  
  <p>Delphus aims to innovate this area, and expand outwards from there. Check out the <a href="https://delph.us">website</a> to learn more.</p>

    content: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1611785">Less than 10% of scientific studies end up being published</a>, even after extensive development, due to extreme costs. Unfortunately, innovation in the methods used to run these studies has stagnated.
